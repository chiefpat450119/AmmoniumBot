# Ammonium Bot
Reddit bot that corrects people's grammar/spelling.
Corrects "should of", "to much", "loosing", and more, so we can all browse free from these atrocities.
See the project in action [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/ammonium_bot)

Stats are available in the stats.json file, listing the number of "good bot" and "bad bot" comments, as well as the number of corrections made.

What's next:
- Make the bot responses more friendly so I get less hate :(
- Optimise the script (we don't talk about the time complexity)
- Use a database or better data structures to store data
- Make a webpage for stats?
